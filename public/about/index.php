    			<p class="about">
    				I have my moments of insecurity and figuring out what's going on and what I'm supposed to do, but if you don't push yourself, you're not growing, so where do you go? I realize everybody wants what they don't have. But at the end of the day, what you have inside is much more beautiful than what's on the outside! So walk on with faith and hope.
